# My Python repo
<!--- Adding a one-line description of what this repository is for here may be
helpful -->
<!---

We recommend having a status line in your repo to tell anyone who stumbles
on your repository where you're up to. Some suggested options:

- prototype: the project is just starting up and the code is all prototype
- development: the project is actively being worked on
- finished: the project has achieved what it wanted and is no longer being
  worked on, we won't reply to any issues
- dormant: the project is no longer worked on but we might come back to it, if
  you have questions, feel free to raise an issue
- abandoned: this project is no longer worked on and we won't reply to any
  issues

-->

## Status

- prototype: the project is just starting up and the code is all prototype

## Installation

We do all our environment management using [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).
To get started, you will need to make sure that uv is installed
([instructions here](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/),
we found that using uv's standalone installer was best on a Mac).

To create the virtual environment, run

```sh
uv install
uv run pre-commit install
```

These steps are also captured in the `Makefile` so if you want a single
command, you can instead simply run `make virtual-enviroment`.

Having installed your virtual environment, you can now run commands in your
virtual environment using

```sh
uv run <command>
```

For example, to run Python within the virtual environment, run

```sh
uv run python
```

<!--- Other documentation and instructions can then be added here as you go,
perhaps replacing the other instructions above as they may become redundant.
-->

## Development

<!--- In bigger projects, we would recommend having separate docs where this
development information can go. However, for such a simple repository, having
it all in the README is fine. -->

Install and run instructions are the same as the above (this is a simple
repository, without tests etc. so there are no development-only dependencies).

### Contributing

This is a very thin repository. There aren't any strict guidelines for
contributing, partly because we don't know what we're trying to achieve (we're
just exploring). If you would like to contribute, it is best to raise an issue
to discuss what you want to do (without a discussion, we can't guarantee that
any contribution can actually be used).
<!--- You may want to update this section as the project evolves. -->

### Repository structure

The repository is very basic. It imposes no structure on you so you can layout
your Python files, notebooks etc. in any way you wish. We do have a basic
`Makefile` which captures key commands in one place (for more thoughts on why
this makes sense, see
[general principles: automation](https://gitlab.com/znicholls/mullet-rse/-/blob/main/book/general-principles/automation.md)).
For an introduction to `make`, see
[this introduction from Software Carpentry](https://swcarpentry.github.io/make-novice/).
Having said this, if you're not interested in `make`, you can just copy the
commands out of the `Makefile` by hand and you will be 90% as happy for a
simple repository like this.

### Tools

In this repository, we use the following tools:

- git for version-control (for more on version control, see
  [general principles: version control](https://gitlab.com/znicholls/mullet-rse/-/blob/main/book/theory/version-control.md))
    - for these purposes, git is a great version-control system so we don't
      complicate things any further. For an introduction to Git, see
      [this introduction from Software Carpentry](http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/).
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for environment management
  (for more on environment management, see
  [general principles: environment management](https://gitlab.com/znicholls/mullet-rse/-/blob/main/book/theory/environment-management.md))
    - there are lots of environment management systems.
      uv works well in our experience.
    - we track the `uv.lock` file so that the environment
      is completely reproducible on other machines or by other people
      (e.g. if you want a colleague to take a look at what you've done)
- [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) with some very basic settings to get some
  easy wins in terms of maintenance, specifically:
    - code formatting with [ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/formatter/)
    - basic file checks (removing unneeded whitespace, not committing large
      files etc.)
    - (for more thoughts on the usefulness of pre-commit, see
      [general principles: automation](https://gitlab.com/znicholls/mullet-rse/-/blob/main/book/general-principles/automation.md)
